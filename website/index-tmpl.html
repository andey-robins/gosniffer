                    This page shows all the different wifi networks that are being looked for by all the devices around us. When a wifi device is not connected to its favorite network it sends out a broadcast looking for all the different wifi networks it has connected to in the past. This information can be used in conjunction with a war-driving database which is a database of wifi signal names and their geographic location. This can be dangerous information if used by the wrong people as it can provide a map of your favorite hangout spots. <br>

                    <b>How do I fix this?</b><br>
                    - Check your wifi settings to see if you have a randomized network name setting <br>
                    - Delete any remembered networks that you rarely connect to <br>
                    - Turn off wifi when you know you're not trying to connect to one <br>
